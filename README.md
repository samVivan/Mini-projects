1- 28 is usually played by four players in fixed partnerships, partners facing each other. 32 cards from a standard 52-card pack are used for play. There are eight cards in each of the usual "French" suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. The cards in every suit rank from high to low: J-9-A-10-K-Q-8-7. The aim of the game is to win tricks containing valuable cards.
The total number of points in the deck is 28, hence the name of the game. The values of the cards are:

    Jacks = 3 points each
    Nines = 2 points each
    Aces = 1 point each
    Tens = 1 point each
    Other cards = (K, Q, 8, 7) no points
    
 
 2 - GUessing the number is a game for people to pass some time .... Player 1 has to enter a number between 0-9 and player 2 has to guess that number
